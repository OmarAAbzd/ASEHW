# ASE Labs HW2 starter

This is the starter project for the second homework exercise. You should use the Langium playground to design and test out your language.

Once you feel it is finished copy the created language grammar into the `src/language/hw-2.langium` file. This project is prepared with GitHub Actions that will fail if you have made some mistakes.

The detailed exercise can be found at https://github.com/ftsrg-edu/ase-labs/wiki/Homework-Part-2-%E2%80%90-Textual-Modeling.
